      <p>Good.</p>
      <p>I do not have to explain such a simple game.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you are more intelligent than I originally determined.</p>

      <p>How sad.</p>
      <p>It is such a simple game.</p>
      <p>You are less intelligent than I originally determined. Oh well.</p>
      <p>The game is played between any number of people, typically only two. There will only be two today.<br>Each person selects their weapon, either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.<br>Rock wins against Scissors, for stone can bend and destroy metal.<br>Paper wins against Rock, for it covers stone and makes it invisible.<br>Scissors win against Paper, for they can easily cut the thin material apart.</p>
      <p>Now you know how to play, so we can move on.</p>

      <p>You have chosen to pick your own opponent. Very well.</p>
      <p>I will list them for you here.</p>
      <p>
      <div>Vanza Thrkhavor - Fang of Manipulation: She has little experience, so you may win easily.
        <br>Lzaenoth Hajthjng - Fang of Banality: I have heard that she uses the same weapon every time.
        <br>Dnohoth Hajthjng - Fang of Apathy: He cares not if he wins or loses.
        <br>Hlfasta Bthfesteuu - Fang of Selfishness: She is known to cheat.
        <br>Kavvjng Abtherek - Fang of Subjugation: He is undefeated. You have no chance of beating him.
        <br>Ithng Chdnoth - Fang of Tenacity: He is difficult to read. He is a thespian, of course.
        <br>Knfe Thorftuu - Fang of Intolerance: He is skillful, but not too difficult to defeat.
        <br>Thengstuu Dnech - Fang of Excessiveness: He does not take this too seriously. You should best him easily.
        <br>Me, Astherek Abtherek - Fang of Unconditional Hatred: All you should know is that I am far superior to you. Leave your illusions of winning behind.
