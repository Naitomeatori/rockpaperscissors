INFO

This is a small Rock-paper-Scissors game I created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The game is played by inputting premade commands into a psuedo-command line interface. 
It's hosted by one of the main characters of my novel "The Princess of Love and Strife," who is definitely a jerkbag. 
If you don't want to deal with him, don't play.

The game progresses by using set stage commands that react to which choice you make. 
The game is not dynamic, it does not have any AI, and it will not respond in new and funny ways if you repeatedly make incorrect choices. 
This is a very straightforward system. 
Read the dialogue, respond with the option(s) dictated, and progress through the game. 
The game ends when you win, lose, or draw in the game of rock-paper-scissors. 
You will be given the option to replay the game without going through the "tutorial" if you want.
If you choose to leave, the window will automatically close itself.

This little game was inspired by the Codecademy JavaScript course, where it tasks you with making a similar "game." 
I decided to go the extra mile and create an entire input-driven game from that prompt. 
The idea for the CLI format was all mine! 
I did borrow code from spkml (https://codepen.io/spkml) for the CLI. 
It's mainly the text-typer plugin and the input handler, although I made quite a bit of changes and I think I may have altered the input handler. 
I also took advantage of OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 to proofread my code. 
Most of the time, the GPT completely messed it up, which helped me find the actual problem. 
This game took me a week of work to complete. 
Most of that time was spent figuring out the best way to structure the thing in the first place, though. 
I originally tried to reference a text game that used objects, but that didn't work for me. 
ChatGPT-3.5 actually showed me how to combine switches with the set stage logic.

This game has been tested by me and others to ensure it functions properly. Please report any issues you have so I can fix them.
